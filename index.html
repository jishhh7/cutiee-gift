        <h3>Happy Birthday Cutiee 🎉</h3>
        <p>Wowww u r turning 19 (grown up)</p>
        <br>
        <p>I'll always love you deep in heart.<br>
        Even if we're not together, you'll always be my cutiee whom I've irritated, teased, annoyed, loved a lot. Spending time with you was the most memorable time for me.</p>
        <p>Ukw, I'm missing youuu so badly Tejdeep, it feels like hell trust me!!<br>
        You're one of the best people I've ever met so far.<br>
        Our first meet felt like a dream to me — you walking beside me in the night with rain drizzling — it was perfect.😭</p>
        <p>I was so sleepy during our movie date 'cause I didn’t sleep at night, was thinking about our first meet 😁<br>
        And even when the whole world knew about us, I didn’t care. Just wanted more time with you.</p>
        <p>Our last meet — I was angry, then I wasn't... that's what you do to me 😭<br>
        I had my first kiss, chocolate from my love, a perfect day...</p>
        <p>Tejdeep, you will always be my special one.<br>
        If I could time travel, I'd go back to those moments.</p>
        <p>I hope you had a memorable time with me too. Did you?</p>
        <p>I’m so sorry... and I love you 💖</p>
